This project attempts to solve the CAPTCHAS from the library https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodejs-captcha automatically with a CNN!

First start the web application,
then run the python script to solve the CAPTCHA challenge on the page automatically:
```
npm start
python3.8 captcha_breaker.py
```

The training dataset was generated by dataset/image-scraper.js, preprocessing
was done in dataset/preprocessing.ipynb and the model was trained in model.ipynb.
